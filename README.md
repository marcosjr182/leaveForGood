Leave for Good is a project hosted by [Blue 1647](http://www.blue1647.com/)

As part of a Summer Internship, I was able to work on my version of it's platform.
For now, I have not been able to work on it but I do intend to make it a Rails API. Creating also an separated front end repository in the future.
